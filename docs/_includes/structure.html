     <center><p> DOS and DON'TS are currently divided into three categories:  </p></center>
     <div class="row">
     <div class="col-xs-offset-3 col-sm-offset-4 col-md-offset-4 col-lg-offset-5"> 
     <p>1. Study Design </p>  
     <p>2. Model Selection </p>
     <p>3. Data Interpretation</p>
     </div>
     </div> 
<p> Version 1.0 focuses on Study Design (based on a paper published in <i>Climate Services</i> in September 2018).  Model Selection guidelines are being drafted and will consitute the majority of updates for version 2.0, coming soon.  Data Interpretation guidelines are conceptualized and will be a future focus area as resources allow. </p>
<p> Each DO or DON'T contains: (1) explanations for why it is important, (2) frequently asked questions by information users and/or case study examples, and (3) recommended paths forward. This framework serves as a foundation for further refinement which can promote dialogue between those who produce the information and those who use it. We use references throughout; the full citations of which can be found under <a href={{ "/foundations/#references" | prepend: site.baseurl }}><b>FOUNDATIONS</b></a>.</p>
<p> These are general guidelines intended to promote better understanding. We recognize there are usually exceptions to every rule.  However, without defining rules, we can’t define exceptions.  We discuss exceptions in our explanation and welcome suggestions for additions and further clarifications (continue scrolling down or click <a href="#participation"><b>here</b></a> to learn more about joining the conversation).
