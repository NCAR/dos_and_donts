whyp1: "Climate information is typically generated for spatial grids, that are then routed to the location of interest or averaged across watersheds. Depending on the impact being evaluated, certain aggregations might be more useful.  Streamflow values include the entire area upstream of the gage, where watersheds are often based on the polygon of the Hydrologic Unit (which do not always include the headwaters)."  
whyp2: "This DON’T will give examples of what these different aggregations are and how they have been employed in past studies."
