whyp1: "Deciding what datasets and models are most appropriate depends on the impact of interest, which is closely tied to the physical location. Geographically diverse regions have unique climatic and hydrologic characteristics that are determined by influences like latitude, terrain complexity, proximity to large water bodies, and global atmospheric circulation patterns.  Additionally, models are developed and tested in specific locations, resulting in certain models being more skillful in capturing certain environmental attributes better than others."
